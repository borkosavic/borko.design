                        Researchers around the world were trying to navigate the platform which felt more like a maze than a resource. How did this occur? MDPI is an open-access publisher that prides itself on offering fast and transparent publishing services for peer-reviewed journals across various fields like science, technology, and medicine. One of their initiatives, SciProfiles, was created as an online space for the scientific community to connect, exchange ideas and cooperate.

                        Platform is not profitable itself, but the idea is to keep the users within MDPI ecosystem.

                        When I joined, the UX/UI was being handled by developers, with occasional input from graphic designers. The goal for the project was to completely revamp SciProfiles - not just to make it more user-friendly but also to demonstrate the value of UX design as a practice by showing how much of a difference it could make.
