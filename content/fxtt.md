# FX Trading Tool

## Executive Summary
### About the Project
This is an internal tool used by Singapore and Hong-Kong branches of HSBC Bank. It’s used by private bankers to facilitate foreign currency exchange on behalf of the high-ranking clients. 

Unfortunately, I’m not allowed to show any visuals but I’ll describe the journey.  
### My Role
- Designed user flows and wireframes for the trading interface.
- Delivered prototypes that adhered to HSBC’s strict UI guidelines.
- Collaborated with developers to ensure seamless implementation.
### Challenges
- Working within strict confidentiality and security constraints.
- Limited UI components due to pre-approved design systems.
- No access to real users for testing.

### Solutions
- Used insights from stakeholders to define user needs and workflows.
- Leveraged HSBC’s design system to ensure consistency and compliance.
- Delivered detailed prototypes and design documentation for implementation.
### Results
- Delivered the project on time, meeting HSBC’s high standards for usability and security.
- Streamlined workflows for private bankers managing high-value transactions.

## What is it about
HSBC Bank’s premium clients have dedicated private bankers who use this tool to execute currency exchanges upon request. These transactions go beyond standard exchanges, involving complex parameters like futures, spot, and forward rates, with an additional option for ultra-high-net-worth clients to purchase bullion. While I can’t share visuals due to confidentiality, I included this project in my portfolio because of the unique challenges it posed. Working in a highly secure banking environment, with limited UI components and no direct access to real users, made the UX process both demanding and intriguing. 

## What did I do?
I was the only designer on the project. I was communicating exclusively with stakeholders  who were very knowledgeable about the product and it’s usage. 

### Research
I got a pretty good idea about who are the users and in which environment are they using the product from stakeholder interviews, but I also had to learn a lot about the product itself.

### Collaboration
As I was the only person from the development team with some background in economics, I was often the one who was “translating” the business requirements to the colleagues.

### Sketching
Before the UI design, we were using an HSBC’s internal sketching tool for quick drafts.

### UI Design
Using the HSBC’s UI elements, I designed the approved screens in Sketch. Figma or any other cloud-based tool was not allowed.

## How did it all happen?
When I was onboarded, I got a super-secure laptop without internet connection from which all the work was done. After I got a grasp of the product, I started the design in micro increments - I presented the yesterday’s work in daily meetings and where I also got assigned what to do next. We did have two week sprints, but most of the design work was done on a daily basis, solving one small problem after another and incrementally building up the sketches  and later visual design for implementation.


## What’s the outcome?
The app was successfully developed and delivered on schedule. As with all internal HSBC tools, it adhered to strict guidelines and used pre-approved UI components from their design system, leaving little room for UI experimentation. This made it one of the most unusual projects I’ve ever worked on.

### What did I learn?
- A lot about the banking sector - both about the products and different development procedures.
- Strict adherence to guidelines limits the innovation but by taking the guesswork out it vastly improves the speed of development
