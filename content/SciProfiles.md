## Executive Summary
### About the Project
A networking and collaboration platform for the scientific community, designed to serve diverse user needs like casual networking, research paper sharing, and peer review management.
### My Role
- Redesigned the information architecture to accommodate a variety of user paths
- Conducted user research and testing to refine platform features.
- Developed a Figma-based design system to unify UI development.
### Challenges
- Managing the needs of seven distinct personas with varying user behaviors.
- Balancing dense scientific data presentation with usability and legibility.

### Solutions
- Streamlined navigation with a card-sorting exercise to restructure information architecture.
- Built a robust design system to support scalability and consistency.
- Conducted iterative testing to optimize user experience for editors, authors, and researchers.
### Results
- 20x growth in monthly active users within one year.
- Improved platform usability and satisfaction across all personas.
- Design system adopted across MDPI’s platforms, enhancing development speed and consistency.

## What is it about

Researchers around the world were trying to navigate the platform which felt more like a maze than a resource. How did this occur? MDPI is an open-access publisher that prides itself on offering fast and transparent publishing services for peer-reviewed journals across various fields like science, technology, and medicine. One of their initiatives, SciProfiles, was created as an online space for the scientific community to connect, exchange ideas and cooperate. Platform is not profitable itself, but the idea is to keep the users within MDPI ecosystem. 

When I joined, the UX/UI was being handled by developers, with occasional input from graphic designers. The goal for the project was to completely revamp SciProfiles - not just to make it more user-friendly but also to demonstrate the value of UX design as a practice by showing how much of a difference it could make.


## What did I do?
I was the only designer in a project-based team of developers and managers. I had a close collaboration with stakeholders too. 

### Research

Fascilitated all the kinds of user research -  focus groups, user interviews, card sorting exercise as well as a lot of stakeholder interviews.

### Design System

SciProfiles was using several UI components from a PHP framework it’s built on - I’ve completely rehauled it in cooperation with dev team.  

### UX/UI Design

As a sole designer, I owned the whole process and all the deliverables - from initial sketches, wireframes and user flows to the implementation

### Testing

I facilitated user testing (on prototypes and after implementation) and helped with the QA process

## How did it all happen?
I started by diving into the project and running research activities. The biggest gripe was the messy Information Architecture - one developer joked, “I can’t even find a feature I coded last week!” So, I kicked things off with a card sorting exercise. With no clear timeline in place, I juggled research and began laying the groundwork for a design system to provide developers with material they could start implementing.

Once I had a solid understanding of the platform, users, and business needs, I worked with stakeholders to set tactical goals and define a timeline. We adopted design sprints to quickly test ideas and deliver the successful ones. With so many features to tackle, this cycle of brainstorming, testing, and iterating kept us busy for almost a year.

## Research
SciProfiles has a highly diverse user base, encompassing seven distinct personas, each with unique ways of using the platform. Regular users focused on casual networking, some authors searched for co-authors, others were searching for research papers they could cite, and editors sought out peer reviewers. This variety resulted in a wide range of user paths to accommodate.

### Key Findings

#### Diverse User Base 
There were a lot of different user flows we identified, however with good information architecture and careful planing we managed to merged some of them without much disruption.

#### Cultural Differences
Testing with users from various geographical and cultural groups yielded interesting findings. Even though some trends suggests removing colours from UI, majority of users preferred colour-coding for different elements.

#### Information Arhitecture
Card sorting exercise with three different groups resulted in a homogenous information architecture that was vastly different from the one we started with

## Problem
First version of the SciProfiles was desktop-only and as we had to gradually swap modules during the redesign it was decided to create fully redesigned desktop version first and then adapt it for mobile and tablet breakpoint. I did suggest the mobile-first approach, but it would take more development resources and due to “survivor bias” some stakeholders claimed that mobile version is not that important as there weren’t many users browsing from their mobile devices. This was, of course, true as we the minimal supported width was 768px. 

## Solution
The work on mobile version of platform started only after the whole redesign was released. This is in contrast with the best practices, but we managed to mitigate most of the drawbacks. With careful planning and utilisation of atomic design principles in the design system alongside with auto-layout features in Figma, design and development for smaller screens turned out to be easier than anticipated - after a year-long work on the desktop version, mobile and tablet version were ready in less than a month. 

## Problem
Information overload posed a significant challenge for many of SciProfiles’ features. The scientific community adheres to strict set of  rules regarding what information must be displayed and the order in which it should appear. As a result, both user and publication pages and modules often felt overcrowded with mandatory details. After all, since MDPI’s core business is publishing, ensuring legibility was top priority. Balancing sufficient white space with optimal screen utilization was a major design challenge.

## Solution
To address the issue, we invested significant effort into ideation and experimentation, exploring layouts that balanced information density with usability. While the solution wasn’t entirely aesthetic, careful adjustments allowed us to present the necessary information more effectively. User testing played a crucial role, confirming that users didn’t mind the increased density as they prioritized access to detailed data over visual minimalism and . By focusing on functionality and legibility, we mitigated the problem and delivered a design that met user and business needs.

## What’s the outcome?
The redesign proved to be a great success, boosting 20x increase in monthly active users - from 5k to 20k.

### What did I learn?
- Solid design system and planning proved to be beneficial to increased speed and lowered complexity of deliveries
- Expert users don’t mind clutter if it increases the usability
- For the first time ever I was getting user testing results that I really haven’t anticipated at all
