# HomeRules Poker

## Executive Summary
### About the Project
An innovative digital poker game that replaces physical cards and chips with smartphones for private cards and a shared device for community cards.

### My Role
- Led user research and usability testing to understand player preferences and expectations.
- Designed game mechanics and interactions that mimic traditional poker gestures.
- Created intuitive workflows for the gameplay.

### Challenges
- Convincing poker players to adopt a digital alternative without losing the traditional experience.
- Developing entirely new game mechanics for a unique multi-device setup.

### Solutions
- Designed natural gestures like peeking at cards and swiping chips to mimic physical gameplay.
- Integrated Alexa for voice-activated setup, simplifying the game-start process.
- Conducted extensive prototyping and testing to refine mechanics and UX.
### Results
- Successfully developed the product, but it never got released :( 

## What is it about
HomeRules Poker brings players back to the table - iterally - by blending digital tools with the social essence of in-person poker. Players use their phones to view player cards, while a shared screen (TV, tablet or a PC) displays community cards, eliminating the need for a dealer or a physical poker set. Plus, it keeps players phones busy with the game, so everyone stays focused on playing instead of scrolling through social media while hanging out with friends.

As my role was UX only, I’m showcasing the work we used to test the game mechanics - this is intentionally not polished for end users. 


## What did I do?
We were a team of six people - 3 UX and 3 UI/Graphic designers. I had a UX role - leading qualitative research and figuring out game mechanics so good that the poker players would be willing to trade chips and a deck of cards for a smartphone.

### User Research
I conducted interviews and focus groups with poker players to understand their habits and expectations. This research informed key design decisions to align with traditional poker experiences.

### Design-Dev-Business Liaison
I facilitated communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders to ensure alignment on goals and priorities. This involved translating business requirements into actionable design tasks and providing developers with clear design guidance.

### Usability Testing
I organized testing sessions to evaluate features like card viewing, betting, and device connections. Insights from these sessions guided improvements to the interactions.

### Interaction Design
I designed interactions that replicated real-world poker gestures, such as peeking at cards and swiping chips as well as workflows for pairing devices, setting up games, and handling in-game actions. 

## How did it all happen?
We approached the project with a iterative process that emphasized collaboration and testing. At the beginning of each sprint we chose a specific problem to research, design or test. I led qualitative research to gather insights from poker players, focusing on their habits and expectations. Using this feedback, I worked with the team to brainstorm potential solutions and refine the game mechanics to closely mimic the traditional poker experience. Prototypes were quickly created and tested with players to validate concepts and identify areas for improvement. This approach allowed us to iterate rapidly, fine-tune details like gestures and feedback, and ensure the final design felt intuitive and engaging for the target audience.

## Research
This was by far the most research-intensive project I’ve ever worked on, with nearly two years of continuous exploration and iteration. Developing completely new game mechanics required extensive user research and testing to ensure poker players would get a better alternative to physical cards or chips.

### Key Findings

#### Poker players are getting old
Millennials are the last generation which actively plays poker - it’s just not that popular anymore. This meant that we had to design for users who aren’t as tech savvy as younger generations. 

#### Keep it natural
Although there are more efficient ways to complete a task, players always preferred the actions which would mimic the real moves from a game of poker - like hiding screen to reveal the cards or “throwing” chips towards the table.

#### Micro-transactions aren’t micro
While interviewing players about their general gaming behaviour, I was amazed by the amount spent on non-functional in-game purchases.

## Problem
HomeRules Poker requires one table device and several player devices connected to the same server via internet. Game setup is the process of connecting them among themselves. With the aging user-base and often sub-par user experience on most smart TV’s this could easily repel potential players - no-one wants to spend ages typing on a TV’s remote control. Making the game setup process frictionless was one of biggest priorities. 

## Solution
Our initial idea for game setup involved typing a code from the TV into a phone, but this proved too cumbersome on most TV interfaces. Then a simpler solution came to mind—generating a QR code on the table device for players to scan with their phones. While faster, this still required navigating several layers of the TV’s menu just to launch the poker app. During user interviews, I began asking if users had voice assistants at home, and 60% said they did. This sparked the idea to use voice commands to streamline the process. We developed an Alexa skill that could launch the app and display the QR code instantly, making it quick and effortless for players to join the game.


## What’s the outcome?
We solved so many problems (and found the new ones), developers made a fully operational app ran on both Android and iOS, but unfortunately it was never launched due to lack of Go To Market strategy.

### What did I learn?
- How to conduct user research and usability test. This wasn’t the first time I’ve done it, but it was certainly the time I’ve done it the most.
- How to play poker.
- How to create prototype with advanced interaction (proto.io).
