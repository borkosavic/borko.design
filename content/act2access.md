# Act2Access

## Executive Summary
### About the Project
Act2Access was a startup aimed at helping publishers with monetisation by providing premium content to users who blocked the ads - if they choose to complete a survey or take a part in A/B test, thus providing valuable information to the advertiser.

### My Role
- Designed UI components and workflows for both users and publishers.
- Created interactive prototypes for integration into publishing platforms.
- Conducted user testing to validate MVP features.
### Challenges
- Balancing user engagement with revenue generation for publishers.
- Designing for compatibility across various publishing platforms.

### Solutions
- Collaborated with stakeholders to define engagement strategies and interface designs.
- Tested MVP features with focus groups to refine usability.
- Delivered a scalable framework for future platform expansion.

### Results
- Successfully launched the MVP with positive feedback from publishers.
- Provided publishers with actionable insights while maintaining user satisfaction.
- Established a foundation for continued platform growth and innovation.

## What is it about
Act2Access is an replacement for internet advertising which would offer users possibility to view the premium content even when they use ad blocker. The platform offers alternatives like completing surveys or participating in A/B tests, providing valuable insights to publishers while granting users access to the content . As this was an MVP, I worked closely with stakeholders to design and test prototypes that seamlessly integrated interactive content into various publishing platforms. By validating features with internal users through focus groups and user testing, we delivered a solution that balanced user engagement with revenue generation.

## What did I do?
I was the only designer on the project. We had to create several types of surveys and A/B test which would fit into a standard ad space, and the backend system used for creating the campaigns. 

### UI Components
It was only few styles and components, so I wouldn’t call it a “design system”, but nevertheless - I’ve done it before I moved to the design. 

### Stakeholder interviews
Surveys were pretty straight forward, but I had a lot to learn abut the back-office system - how the campaigns were created, run and reported.

### UI/UX Design
As a sole designer, I owned the whole process and all the deliverables - from initial sketches, wireframes and user flows to the implementation

### Testing
I facilitated user testing (on prototypes and after implementation) and helped with the QA process

## How did it all happen?
This was a small project so there was not much planning involved - it was straight up to execution. All the potential users of the system were internal customers which meant that I could reach them any time, so even the research and user testing were not a huge challenge. After I got acquainted with the product and the goals, I quickly drafted the UI elements I needed and started ideating both the surveys and back-office. In collaboration with stakeholders we quickly had a first version running, so the only thing remaining was to improve it to a satisfactory level.

## What’s the outcome?
The whole system was successfully created and tested, but unfortunately it was not released (yet). This was one of “proof of concept” experiments which didn’t find the way to the market. It’s not one of the projects that I’m most proud of either by the quality either by the amount of work I’ve put into, but I nevertheless decided to include it in portfolio to showcase variety of work I’ve done in my career. 

### What did I learn?
- Even though the project is successfully executed, it doesn’t mean that it will go live :)
