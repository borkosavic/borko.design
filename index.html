                    <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Researchers around the world were trying to navigate the platform which felt more like a maze than a resource. MDPI is an open-access publisher that created SciProfiles as an online space for the scientific community to connect, exchange ideas and cooperate. When I joined, the UX/UI was being handled by developers, with occasional input from graphic designers. The goal was to completely revamp SciProfiles - not just to make it more user-friendly but also to demonstrate the value of UX design as a practice.</p>

                    <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
                    <p>I facilitated all kinds of user research - focus groups, user interviews, card sorting exercises as well as stakeholder interviews. SciProfiles has a highly diverse user base, encompassing seven distinct personas: regular users focused on casual networking, authors searching for co-authors, researchers looking for papers to cite, and editors seeking peer reviewers. The biggest challenge was the messy Information Architecture - one developer joked, "I can't even find a feature I coded last week!" Card sorting exercises with three different groups resulted in a homogeneous information architecture that was vastly different from what we started with.</p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>I was the only designer in a project-based team of developers and managers. I started by diving into research activities and running a card sorting exercise. With no clear timeline, I juggled research while laying groundwork for a design system to provide developers with implementable material. Once I had solid understanding of the platform, users, and business needs, I worked with stakeholders to set tactical goals and define a timeline. We adopted design sprints to quickly test ideas and deliver successful ones. This cycle of brainstorming, testing, and iterating kept us busy for almost a year.</p>

                    <h2>Solution & Design</h2>
                    <p>Two major challenges emerged: First, the mobile-first approach was initially rejected due to "survivor bias" - stakeholders claimed mobile wasn't important since few users browsed mobile (because minimum supported width was 768px). We mitigated this by using atomic design principles in our design system and Figma's auto-layout features. After a year-long desktop redesign, mobile and tablet versions were ready in less than a month. Second, information density was crucial for the scientific community's strict display requirements. Through careful ideation and user testing, we found that expert users didn't mind density if it increased usability. We balanced information density with legibility rather than pursuing visual minimalism.</p>

                    <h2>Impact & Results</h2>
                    <p>The redesign was a tremendous success, achieving 20x growth in monthly active users - from 5,000 to 100,000 within one year. The design system was adopted across MDPI's platforms, enhancing development speed and consistency. User satisfaction improved across all seven personas. Key learnings: solid design systems and planning increase delivery speed while lowering complexity; expert users prioritize functionality over visual minimalism; and comprehensive user testing can reveal completely unexpected insights.</p>

                    <p>Act2Access was a startup aimed at helping publishers with monetization by providing premium content to users who blocked ads. The platform offered alternatives like completing surveys or participating in A/B tests, providing valuable insights to publishers while granting users access to content. The challenge was creating a replacement for internet advertising that would offer users the possibility to view premium content even when using ad blockers, while ensuring publishers could still generate revenue and gather valuable user insights.</p>

                    <p>As the only designer on the project, I worked closely with stakeholders through interviews to understand both the user-facing and back-office systems. I needed to learn about how campaigns were created, run, and reported. All potential users were internal customers, which meant I could reach them anytime for research and testing. This internal access made research and user testing more straightforward than typical projects.

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>This was a small project with minimal planning involved - we moved straight to execution. After getting acquainted with the product and goals, I quickly drafted the UI elements needed and started ideating both the user-facing surveys and the back-office system. I created UI components and workflows for both users and publishers, designing interactive prototypes that could integrate into various publishing platforms. The process involved rapid iteration with stakeholders to quickly get a first version running, then improving it to a satisfactory level through continuous testing and refinement.</p>

                    <p>The system was successfully created and tested with positive feedback from publishers. We established a foundation for continued platform growth and provided publishers with actionable insights while maintaining user satisfaction. However, this was ultimately a "proof of concept" experiment that didn't find its way to market. Key learning: even when a project is successfully executed, it doesn't guarantee it will go live. While not the most complex project in terms of scope, it showcased the variety of work and rapid MVP development capabilities in the startup environment.</p>

                    <p>Imagine a technician in a service corridor, trying to configure an HVAC valve via smartphone. Belimo Assistant was created to solve these exact challenges - bringing efficiency to professionals worldwide. It replaced three separate apps that were used for the same purpose. By connecting to Belimo devices via cable, internet, Bluetooth, or NFC, the app enables users to configure and monitor performance parameters, diagnose issues, and adjust settings directly from PC, smartphone, or tablet. The main objective was to quickly design and develop a multi-platform app for commissioning and maintenance of Belimo products, as the preceding apps had reached end of life.</p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>I started as the sole designer, later joined by two additional UX/UI designers. Initially, I focused on understanding project goals through stakeholder interviews, which proved most insightful despite extensive documentation. Early on, I noticed inefficiencies in fragmented design tools (Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, Confluence, Zeplin, Jira) and proposed Figma as the single source of truth. Using design tokens and atomic design principles, I migrated the entire system to Figma, leveraging auto layout, nested components, and variables. I simultaneously built a robust design system while brainstorming features and tackling complex connection methods through interactive prototypes.</p>

                    <h2>Solution & Design</h2>
                    <p>I addressed two major challenges: First, tool fragmentation was solved by centralizing everything in Figma, which was adopted across all seven ongoing projects. This enabled faster iterations, leaner communication, and interactive prototypes on real devices. Second, connection complexity across multiple platforms and seven connection methods was addressed through careful error categorization. I designed for "unhappy paths," reducing user-required actions for connection errors from 80% to 20%. For NFC alignment issues, I used the device shape as a visual hint in the top bar and implemented haptic feedback patterns since users often couldn't see the screen while positioning their phone.</p>

                    <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
                    <p>This was by far the most research-intensive project I've worked on, with nearly two years of continuous exploration. As part of a six-person team (3 UX, 3 UI designers), I led qualitative research to understand poker players' habits and expectations. Key findings revealed that millennials are the last generation actively playing poker - it's not popular with younger generations. This meant designing for users who aren't as tech-savvy. Players always preferred actions that mimic real poker moves, like hiding screens to peek at cards or "throwing" chips toward the table. Surprisingly, players spent significant amounts on non-functional in-game purchases during interviews about gaming behavior.</p>

                    <p>I designed natural gestures replicating real-world poker actions and workflows for device pairing, game setup, and in-game actions. The biggest challenge was game setup - connecting multiple devices with aging users and poor TV interfaces. Initial solutions involved typing codes, then QR codes, but both were cumbersome. During interviews, I discovered 60% of users had voice assistants. This sparked developing an Alexa skill that could launch the app and display QR codes instantly, making player joining quick and effortless. The solution integrated voice activation to streamline the traditionally complex setup process while maintaining natural poker-like interactions.</p>
